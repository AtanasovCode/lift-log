# LiftLog

LiftLog is a web application that provides users with an intuitive and visually rich platform for tracking their workouts and individual exercises. The application offers detailed statistics and charts to help users monitor their strength gains and keep track of their strongest lifts. Additionally, LiftLog allows users to track their workout consistency over time, empowering them to make informed decisions about their training regimen.

# Status

Based on my estimates, LiftLog is about 65% complete and needs some more time in development before it is fully released. The following features are currently being worked on:

    Tracking up to 6 different exercises and their personal records (PRs)
    Tracking consistency, including a custom-coded heat map to visualize workouts
    Improvements to the current Results page

Progress: [====================> ] 65%
